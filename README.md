Congressional Voting Records of the Senate

Spermatozoa Basic Mobility
--------------------------

The basic sperm movement was from: 
[Sperm Movement Source](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1136236)

Working Idea
------------

The sperm are attracted to the Yea or Nay eggs depending on what each Congressman voted for.
Each dataset only contains that of the Senate. The non-voting senators will remain floating 
around the page.

How to Use
----------

There are 5 preloaded bills on the project. Use the buttons to iterate through them. Once a bill is a loaded, the sperm automatically swim towards the Y coordinate of the Yea or Nay egg. The user can click on each sperm to display the information of that sperm.
